MAC OS X INSTALLATION
---------------------

1. "CayenneModeler.app" is the GUI modeler. Drag it to a folder where you 
   normally put your applications (e.g. in the "Applications" folder). It 
   requires Java 7 or newer.

2. "CayenneModeler-Java6-Legacy.app" is the same exact version of the modeler
   as "CayenneModeler.app", except that it works with older Apple Java 1.6.
   Use it only if the regular modeler fails to start on your Mac.
   
3. "cayenne-xxx" folder contains Cayenne documentation and runtime libraries. Drag it
   anywhere you would normally place such things.
