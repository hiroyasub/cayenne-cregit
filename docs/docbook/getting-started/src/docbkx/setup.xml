    <title>Setup</title>
    <para> The goal of this chapter of the tutorial is to install (or check that you already have

        <title>Install Eclipse IDE and the Maven Plugin</title>
        <para> Download Eclipse. This tutorial is based on the Galileo package (Eclipse 3.5), JEE
            edition, still it should work with any recent vanilla Eclipse distribution. </para>
        <para> After downloading Eclipse, unpack it somewhere in the filesystem, and start it. The
            only plugin that you need for the tutorial is m2eclipse. To install it, in Eclipse go to
            "Help > Install New Software", then click on "Add.." to add a new download site, and
            enter "Maven" in the "Name" field, and "<emphasis role="italic"
                >http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e</emphasis>" in the "Location" field. You
            may install any of the optional components that you think you need, but for this
            tutorial we only select a few basic components as shown on the following screenshot: </para>
