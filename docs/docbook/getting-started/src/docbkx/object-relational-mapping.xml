    <title>Getting started with Object Relational Mapping (ORM)...</title>
    <para> The goal of this section is to learn how to create a simple Object-Relational model with
        CayenneModeler. We will create a complete ORM model for the following database
        schema:</para>

                <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Very often you'd have an existing database already, and
                    it can be quickly imported in Cayenne via "Tools &gt; Reengineer Database
                    Schema". This will save you lots of time compared to manual mapping. However
                    understanding how to create the mapping by hand is important, so we are showing
                    the "manual" approach below.</td>

        <title>Mapping Database Tables and Columns</title>
        <para>Lets go back to CayenneModeler where we have the newly created project open and start
            by adding the ARTIST table. Database tables are called <emphasis role="bold"
                >"DbEntities"</emphasis> in Cayenne mapping (those can be actual tables or database
            views). </para>
        <para>Select "UntitledDomainMap" on the left-hand side project tree and click "Create
            DbEntity" button (or use "Project &gt; Create DbEntity" menu). A new DbEntity is
            created. In "DbEntity Name" field enter "ARTIST". Then click on "Create Attribute"
            button on the entity toolbar (third button from the left). This action changes the view
            to the "Attribute" tab and adds a new attribute (attribute means a "table column" in
            this case) called "untitledAttr". Let's rename it to ID, make it an INTEGER and make it
            a PK:</para>

        <para>Similarly add NAME VARCHAR(200) and DATE_OF_BIRTH DATE attributes. After that repeat
            this procedure for PAINTING and GALLERY entities to match DB schema shown above.</para>

                        avoid losing your work. You will also have to refresh the project in Eclipse
                        after every CayenneModeler save, as Eclipse is by default unaware of any
                        changes made in the Modeler.</td>

        <title>Mapping Database Relationships</title>
        <para>Now we need to specify relationships between ARTIST, PAINTING and GALLERY tables.
            Start by creating a one-to-many ARTIST/PAINTING relationship:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Select the ARTIST DbEntity on the left and click on the "Relationships"
                    tab.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Click on "Create Relationship" button on the entity toolbar (second button
                    from the left) - a relationship called "untitledRel" is created.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Choose the "Target" to be "Painting".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Click on the "Database Mapping" button (letter "I" in a circle) - relationship
                    configuration dialog is presented. Here you can assign a name to the
                    relationship and also its complimentary reverse relationship. This name can be
                    anything (this is really a symbolic name of the database referential
                    constraint), but it is recommended to use a valid Java identifier, as this will
                    save some typing later. We'll call the relationship "paintings" and reverse
                    relationship "artist".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Click on "Add" button on the right to add a join</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Select "ID" column for the "Source" and "ARTIST_ID" column for the
                    target.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Relationship information should now look like this:</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="../images/modeler-dbrelationship.png"/>

            <listitem>
                <para>Click "Done" to confirm the changes and close the dialog.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Two complimentary relationships have been created - from ARTIST to PAINTING
                    and back. Still you may have noticed one thing is missing - "paintings"
                    relationship should be to-many, but "To Many" checkbox is not checked. Let's
                    change that - check the checkbox for "paintings" relationship, and then click on
                    PAINTING DbEntity, and uncheck "artist" relationship "To Many" to make the
                    reverse relationship "to-one" as it should be.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Repeat the steps above to create a many-to-one relationship from PAINTING to
                    GALLERY, calling the relationships pair "gallery" and "paintings".</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="mapping-java-classes">
        <title>Mapping Java Classes</title>
        <para>Now that the database schema mapping is complete, CayenneModeler can create mappings
            of Java classes (aka "ObjEntities") by deriving everything from DbEntities. At present
            there is no way to do it for the entire DataMap in one click, so we'll do it for each
            table individually.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Select "ARTIST" DbEntity and click on "Create ObjEntity" button (a green class
                    icon) either on the entity toolbar or on the main toolbar. An ObjEntity called
                    "Artist" is created with a Java class field set to "cayenne.tutorial.Artist".
                    The modeler transformed the database names to the Java-friendly names (e.g., if
                    you click on the "Attributes" tab, you'll see that "DATE_OF_BIRTH" column was
                    converted to "dateOfBirth" Java class attribute).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Select "GALLERY" DbEntity and click on "Create ObjEntity" button again -
                    you'll see a "Gallery" ObjEntity created.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Finally, do the same thing for "PAINTING".</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Now you need to synchronize relationships. Artist and Gallery entities were created
            when there was no related "Painting" entity, so their relationships were not set. <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Click on the "Artist" ObjEntity and (optinally) change to the
                        "Relationships" tab. Now click on "Sync ObjEntity with DbEntity" button on
                        the toolbar (two yellow arrows) - you will see the "paintings" relationship
                        appear.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Do the same for the "Gallery" entity.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Unless you want to customize the Java class and property names (which you can do
            easily) the mapping is complete. </para>
