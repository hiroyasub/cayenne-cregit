                        Cayenne services. The keys in this map are the property names from the table
                        in Appendix A. Separate copies of this map exist on the server and ROP
                        client.</td>

                    <td><code>cayenne.server.adapter_detectors</code> - List&lt;DbAdapterDetector> that contains
                        objects that can discover the type of current database and install the
                        correct DbAdapter in runtime.</td>

                        default adapter-agnostic ExtendedTypes. Default ExtendedTypes can be
                        overridden / extended by DB-specific DbAdapters as well as by user-provided
                        types configured in another colltecion (see
                        "cayenne.server.user_types").</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><code>cayenne.server.user_types</code> - List&lt;ExtendedType> storing a
                        user-provided ExtendedTypes. This collection will be merged into a full list
                        of ExtendedTypes and would override any ExtendedTypes defined in a default
                        list, or by a DbAdapter.</td>

                <tr>

                        storing default and user-provided ExtendedTypeFactories. ExtendedTypeFactory
                        allows to define ExtendedTypes dynamically for the whole group of Java
                        classes. E.g. Cayenne supplies a factory to map all Enums regardless of
                        their type.</td>

                <tr>

                        String> storing event bridge properties passed to the ROP client on
                        bootstrap. This means that the map is configured by server DI, and passed to
                        the client via the wire. The properties in this map are specific to
                        EventBridgeFactory implementation (e.g JMS or XMPP connection prameters).
                        One common property is "cayenne.server.rop_event_bridge_factory" that
                        defines the type of the factory.</td>
