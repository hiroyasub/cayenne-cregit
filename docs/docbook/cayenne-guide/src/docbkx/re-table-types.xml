    <title>Table Types</title>
    <para>
        By default, cdbimport processes only tables and views from schema, but there are a lot of other objects that could be loaded from database,
        such as <code>SYSTEM TABLE, GLOBAL TEMPORARY, LOCAL TEMPORARY, ALIAS, SYNONYM</code>, etc. Those things are specific for concrete databases and could be accepted
        by the <code language="xml">&lt;tableType&gt;&lt;/tableType&gt;</code> element.
