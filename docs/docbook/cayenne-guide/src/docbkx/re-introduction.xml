    	<title>What is CDBImport</title>
    	<para>
    		CDBImport is a Maven/Ant plugin that helps you to do reverse engineering. In other words it helps you to synchronize
    		database structure with your Cayenne mapping config. It does not update Java classes by itself, but it synchronizes db
    		and data access layer representation in Cayenne mapping file with actual database state.
    		Most common practice to complete reverse engineering is to use CDBImport followed by CGen Maven plugin,
    		which does class generation according to the Cayenne mapping file updates.

		<title>Reverse Engineering configuration file</title>
		<para>
			Cayenne is designed to support database reverse engineering automation process via Maven and Ant build tools. 
			You could control and configure this process in the several ways:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Inside ANT/Maven build file</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Externally in reverseEngineering.xml file, which will be used by Maven/Ant to perform cdbimport</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			Maven and Ant build files usually contain lots of configuration according to your project requirements. This is why reverseEngineering.xml
			is designed as a sum of configuration styles of Maven and Ant. It will be quite easy to use and move your configuration from build file
			definition into separate one. At practice you should be able to cut reverseEngineering section from Maven configuration and paste it into the 
			external reverse engineering file without a problem. Then, put path to this file into config or it could be loaded from the datamap file. 
			It should work for Ant at the same manner.
		</para>
		<para>
			Note that each datamap has its own reverse engineering file, which is described by the &lt;reverse-engineering-config&gt; datamap tag.
			<programlisting language="xml">
			&lt;reverse-engineering-config name="reverseEngineering"/&gt;
			</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
			Here is a default template of reverse engineering file, which should help you to get started:
		</para>
		<programlisting language="xml">
			&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
			&lt;reverseEngineering
       				xmlns="http://cayenne.apache.org/schema/8/reverseEngineering"
       				xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       				xsi:schemaLocation="http://cayenne.apache.org/schema/8/reverseEngineering http://cayenne.apache.org/schema/8/reverseEngineering.xsd"&gt;

    			&lt;skipRelationshipsLoading&gt;false&lt;/skipRelationshipsLoading&gt;
    			&lt;skipPrimaryKeyLoading&gt;false&lt;/skipPrimaryKeyLoading&gt;

    			&lt;catalog&gt;
        			&lt;schema&gt;
            			&lt;includeTable&gt;
            			&lt;/includeTable&gt;
        			&lt;/schema&gt;
    			&lt;/catalog&gt;
    			&lt;includeProcedure pattern=".*"/&gt;
			&lt;/reverseEngineering&gt;
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			Note that the whole database structure will be loaded after execution reverse engineering with this stub.
