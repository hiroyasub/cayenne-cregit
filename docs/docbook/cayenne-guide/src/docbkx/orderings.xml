	<title>Orderings</title>
		<para>An Ordering object defines how a list of objects should be ordered. Orderings are
			essentially path expressions combined with a sorting strategy. Creating an Ordering:
			<programlisting language="java">Ordering o = new Ordering(Painting.NAME_PROPERTY, SortOrder.ASENDING);</programlisting></para>
		<para>Like expressions, orderings are translated into SQL as parts of queries (and the sorting
		occurs in the database). Also like expressions, orderings can be used in memory, naturally -
		to sort
		objects:<programlisting language="java">Ordering o = new Ordering(Painting.NAME_PROPERTY, SortOrder.ASCENDING_INSENSITIVE);
List&lt;Painting> list = ...
o.orderList(list);</programlisting>Note
		that unlike filtering with Expressions, ordering is performed in-place. This list object is
		reordered and no new list is created.</para>
