		<para>Recent versions of Tomcat and Jetty containers (e.g. Tomcat 6 and 7, Jetty 8) are
			addressing a security concern related to "session fixation problem" by resetting the
			existing session ID of any request that requires BASIC authentcaition. If ROP service is
			protected with declarative security (see the the ROP tutorial and the following chapters
			on security), this feature prevents the ROP client from attaching to its session,
			resulting in MissingSessionExceptions. To solve that you will need to either switch to
			an alternative security mechanism, or disable "session fixation problem" protections of
			the container. E.g. the later can be achieved in Tomcat 7 by adding the following
				<emphasis>context.cml</emphasis> file to the webapp's META-INF/ directory:
			<programlisting>&lt;Context>
	&lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.BasicAuthenticator" 
			changeSessionIdOnAuthentication="false" />
&lt;/Context></programlisting>(The
			&lt;Valve> tag can also be placed within the &lt;Context> in any other locations used by
			Tomcat to load context configurations)</para>
