        <para>Normally each ObjEntity is mapped to a specific Java class (such as Artist or
            Painting) that explicitly declare all entity properties as pairs of getters and setters.
            However Cayenne allows to map a completly generic class to any number of entities. The
            only expectation is that a generic class implements
                <emphasis>org.apache.cayenne.DataObject</emphasis>. So an ideal candidate for a
            generic class is CayenneDataObject, or some custom subclass of CayenneDataObject.</para>
        <para>If you don't enter anything for Java Class of an ObjEntity, Cayenne assumes generic
            mapping and uses the following implicit rules to determine a class of a generic object.
            If DataMap "Custom Superclass" is set, runtime uses this class to instantiate new
            objects. If not, org.apache.cayenne.CayenneDataObject is used.</para>
        <para>Class generation procedures (either done in the Modeler or with Ant or Maven) would
            skip entities that are mapped to CayenneDataObject explicitly or have no class
            mapping.</para>
