		<title>Running CayenneModeler</title>
		<para>CayenneModeler GUI tool is intended to work with object relational mapping projects. While
			you can edit your XML by hand, it is rarely needed, as the Modeler is a pretty advanced
			tool included in Cayenne distribution. To obtain CayenneModeler, download Cayenne
			distribution archive from <link xlink:href="http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html"
				>http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html</link> matching the OS you are using. Of
			course Java needs to be installed on the machine where you are going to run the
			Modeler.</para>
		<para>OS X distribution contains CayenneModeler.app at the root of the distribution disk
			image.</para>
		<para>Windows distribution contains CayenneModeler.exe file in the <code>bin</code>
			directory.</para>
		<para>Cross-platform distribution (targeting Linux, but as the name implies, compatible with any
			OS) contains a runnable CayenneModeler.jar in the <code>bin</code> directory. It can be
			executed either by double-clicking, or if the environment is not configured to execute
			jars, by running from command-line:</para>
		<programlisting>java -jar CayenneModeler.jar</programlisting>
		<para>The Modeler can also be started from Maven. While it may look like an exotic way to start a
			GUI application, it has its benefits - no need to download Cayenne distribution, the
			version of the Modeler always matches the version of the framework, the plugin can find
			mapping files in the project automatically. So is an attractive option to some
			developers. Maven option requires a declaration in the
			POM:<programlisting>&lt;build>
    &lt;plugins>
        &lt;plugin>
            &lt;groupId>org.apache.cayenne.plugins&lt;/groupId>
            &lt;artifactId>maven-cayenne-modeler-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
            &lt;version>X.Y.Z&lt;/version>
        &lt;/plugin>
    &lt;/plugins>
&lt;/build></programlisting></para>
		<para>And then can be run as <programlisting>mvn cayenne-modeler:run</programlisting></para>
