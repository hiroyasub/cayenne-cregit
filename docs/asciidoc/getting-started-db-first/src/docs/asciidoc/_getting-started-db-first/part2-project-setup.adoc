=== Creating project

Now we also need to create project file, currently this should be done manually via Cayenne Modeler. 

==== Setup Modeler Maven plugin

To launch Modeler we'll use ``cayenne-modeler-maven-plugin``.
To use it just include it in `pom.xml` like we did with ``cayenne-maven-plugin``: 
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.cayenne.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>cayenne-modeler-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${cayenne.version}</version>
</plugin>
----

To launch it simple use console: 
----
$ mvn cayenne-modeler:run
----

==== Create project

In Modeler start new project and select `File` > ``Import DataMap``.
In File Select dialog select created `datamap.map.xml` file and click ``Select DataMap``.
Now all we need is to save project, click `Save` and select same folder where `datamap.map.xml` file is
(it should be selected by default).
That's all, you should see now `cayenne-project.xml` file in IDEA:

To use newly created project in Modeler later let's configure plugin to open it automatically:
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <modelFile>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/cayenne-project.xml</modelFile>
    </configuration>
----
