=== Reverse Engineering in Cayenne Modeler

Alternative aproach to using <<cdbimport>> is doing reverse engineering from <<CayenneModeler Application, CayenneModeler>>. Currently modeler GUI doesn't support all features of ant/maven tasks but it suffice for general DB import. Especially it's a good place to quickly start working on your data model.

You can find reverse engineering tool in main modeler menu *Tools > Reengineer Database Schema*

==== DataSource selection

First you should select DataSource. If you don't have any DataSource yet you can create one from this menu.

Datasource selection dialog.

==== Reverse engineering options

Once DataSource is selected you can proceed to reverse engineering options.

Reverse Engineering dialog.

Here is a list of options to tune what will be processed by reverse engineering:

- *Select Catalog*: catalog to process

NOTE: You can only select one catalog. If you need to import multiple catalogs you need to run process several times.

- *Table Name Pattern*: RegExp to filter tables. Default pattern .* includes all tables.

- *Procedure Name Pattern*: RegExp to filter procedures. Default pattern .* includes all stored procedures.

- *Naming Strategy*: Currently there is only one naming strategy available. See ant/maven tools <<namingStrategy, documentation>> for details about naming strategy.

- *Tables with Meaningful PK Pattern*: Comma separated list of RegExp's for tables that you want to have meaningful primary keys. By default no meaningful PKs are created.

- *Use Java primitive types*: Use primitive types (e.g. *int*) or Object types (e.g. *java.lang.Integer*).

- *Use old java.util.Date type*: Use *java.util.Date* for all columns with *DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP* types. By default *java.time.* types will be used.
