Apache Cayenne Upgrade Information
==================================

UPGRADING FROM 3.0M1

* Lifecycle Callbacks require no setup:
  Per CAY-843, lifecycle callback functionality is now built into DataContext and DataDomain, 
  so all the custom code to set them up is no longer needed. Also as a result of this change
  'org.apache.cayenne.intercept' package is removed from Cayenne.
  Further information can be found here: http://cayenne.apache.org/doc/lifecycle-callbacks.html

UPGRADING FROM 2.0 AND OTHER APACHE RELEASES

* Jar files:
  - all jar files now include version numbers in their names.
  - "cayenne-nodeps.jar" is renamed to "cayenne-server-x.x.x.jar" 
  - "fat" cayenne.jar file that included dependencies is no longer distributed. 
    All dependencies that it contained are included as separate jars under 
    "cayenne-x.x.x/lib/third-party/". The new "cayenne-server-x.x.x.jar" plus 
    dependencies should be used in place of cayenne.jar.
  - A new "cayenne-agent-x.x.x.jar" is included. It is used for class enhancement 
    with POJO's and JPA. "Classic" Cayenne users can ignore this file.
    
* Cross-platform Modeler Startup is now done without a batch file or a shell script. 
  A "fat" CayenneModeler.jar is included in the "cayenne-x.x.x/bin" directory
  and can be run either by double-clicking the jar (on platforms that support that)
  or by running "java -jar CayenneModeler.jar".
  
* Note that FireBird adapter is no longer distributed with Cayenne. The one we had was half-working
  and we could not support it anymore.
  
* DataContextTransactionEventListener, DataObjectTransactionEventListener, DataContextEvent all were deprecated
  favor of callbacks. NOTE THAT THIS API WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FOLLOWING 3.0 MILESTONES.
  

UPGRADING FROM 1.2 AND OTHER OBJECTSTYLE RELEASES

Since 2.0, Cayenne is an Apache project, so all "org.objectstyle.*" java packages 
where renamed to "org.apache.*" analogues. Since 1.2.x and 2.0.x release lines maintain
full compatibility with each other, differing only in package names, upgrading to 2.0.x
can be a first step in a safe upgrade to the latest version of Cayenne.

* Upgrading mapping files:

To upgrade the mapping files, open them in the new Modeler. You should see an upgrade 
dialog. Once you confirm the upgrade 

* Upgrading the code:

Replace "org.objectstyle." with "org.apache." everywhere in imports and do a clean 
recompile.

* Upgrading logging configuration

If you are using custom logging configuration file, make sure that all the 
Cayenne loggers are changed from "org.objectstyle" to "org.apache".
